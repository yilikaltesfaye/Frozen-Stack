# Project Structure - Frozen Stack ❄️

## Branching Strategy

The **Frozen Stack** repository is organized into multiple branches, each representing a distinct project within the broader "Frozen Stack" ecosystem. These branches are structured to allow each project to be worked on, deployed, and developed independently, while remaining part of the same repository.

---

### Branch Naming Convention

Each branch name follows a structured convention:

- **Category/Project Type**: e.g., `web`, `mobile`, `games`
- **Specific Technology or Framework**: e.g., `react`, `nodejs`, `flutter`
- **Project Name or Version**: e.g., `project-1`, `app`, etc.

### How to Work with Branches:

1. **Cloning the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository and navigating into it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yilikaltesfaye/frozen-stack.git
   cd frozen-stack
   ```

2. **Switching to a Branch**: To explore a specific project, switch to the corresponding branch. For example, to work on a React frontend project, you would use:

   ```bash
   git checkout web/frontend/react-project-1
   ```

3. **Project Setup**: Once you're in the desired branch, the project files for that branch will be available **directly in the root of the repository** (not in subdirectories). Each branch represents a complete project located at the root level of the repository.

4. **Working on the Project**: After switching to the branch, you can start developing and testing the project locally.

5. **Pushing Changes**: If you make any changes and wish to push them back to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin web/frontend/react-project-1
   ```

6. **Deployment**: Deploy each project to platforms like **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **GitHub Pages** directly from the respective branch. These platforms allow you to link to specific branches for easy deployment.

### Example Projects Structure

#### Example Project: `web/frontend/react-project-1`

1. **Branch**: `web/frontend/react-project-1`

2. **Folder Structure** (in the branch `web/frontend/react-project-1`):
   The project files will be located **directly in the root of the repository**:

   ```
   frozen-stack/
       ├── src/
       ├── public/
       ├── README.md
       ├── package.json
   ```

3. **Deployment**:

   - Link the `web/frontend/react-project-1` branch to **Vercel** or **Netlify** for deployment.
   - The deployment will automatically use the project files from the branch to deploy the React app.

4. **Instructions**: Each project within the branch will have its own README to help with setting up and running the project. For example:

   ```bash
   # To install dependencies:
   npm install

   # To run the project locally:
   npm start
   ```
